# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
### Part I: 
Process reading and math proficiency standards test data for analysis, reporting, and presentation to provide insights to City School performance and trends.  This information will be used to inform discussions and make strategic decisions at school and district levels.  The analysis includes:
1. District summary
1. School summary
1. Top and bottom five performing schools (based on the overall passing rate)
1. Average math and reading scores for each grade level from each school
1. Scores by school spending per student, by school size and by school type

### Part II: 
The school board discovered evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, the reading and math scores for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered.  A revised School District Analysis was conducted, excluding the Thomas High School ninth grade reading and math scores.

 ## Results, comparing the revised and original analyses:
 * _District Summary how affected?_ 
 
 * _School Summary   How is the school summary affected?_
 
 * _Thomas High School Performance relative to other schoolds  How does replacing the ninth graders' math and reading scores affect Thomas High School's performance relative to the other schools?
 
 * _Replacing the ninth-grade scores affect on the following:
 ** Math and reading scores by grade
 
 ** Scores by school spending
 
 ** Scores by school size
 
 ** Scores by school type

 ## Summary: Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
